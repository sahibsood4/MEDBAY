## 🩺 Problem Statement

In traditional pharmacies, patients face several issues:

1. **Medicine Selection Delay**  
   Patients often wait while pharmacists manually determine which medicine fits the described symptoms or illness. This leads to inefficiency and long queues.

2. **Manual Stock Management**  
   Pharmacies track inventory by hand, with no automated alerts for low stock or out-of-stock situations, leading to missed sales and customer frustration.

3. **No Demand-Driven Analytics**  
   There is no system in place to analyze local demand for medicines, which can result in overstocking unpopular drugs and understocking essentials.

4. **Health Risks During Pandemics**  
   During lockdowns or viral outbreaks, visiting medical stores poses a high health risk, but medicine is a non-negotiable necessity.

5. **Lack of Transparency**  
   Patients are often overcharged or given incorrect medication due to lack of pricing clarity or verification systems.
